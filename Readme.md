# Local use vs deployment
This plugin was originally designed as a local editor -- you run hexo locally, use `hexo-admin` to author posts, and then use `hexo generate` or `hexo deploy` to send the generated static HTML files up to github pages or some other static server.

However, `hexo-admin` can be run on your live blog, as long as you're using a non-static hosting service such as Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc. Static hosting services such as Github pages and Surge.sh does not support running hexo-admin from your live site.
If you're using Hexo admin from your live blog, you should definitely set up a password (see below) -- otherwise anyone will be able to edit your content.

# Quickstart
### 1. Setup hexo & create a blog
```sh
npm install -g hexo
cd ~/
hexo init my-blog
cd my-blog
npm install
```
### 2. Install the admin & start things up
```sh
npm install --save hexo-admin-yf
hexo server -d
open http://localhost:4000/admin/
```

### 3. Password protection
If you're using Hexo admin on your live server, you want some password
protection. To enable this, you just add a few config variables to your hexo
`_config.yml`:

```
admin:
  username: myfavoritename
  password_hash: be121740bf988b2225a313fa1f107ca1
  secret: a secret something
```

The `password_hash` is the bcrypt hash of your password. The `secret` is used
to make the cookies secure, so it's a good idea to have it be long and
complicated.

A utility in Hexo admin's Settings can hash your password and generate the `admin`
section for you. Start Hexo and go to `Settings > Setup authentification`
and fill out your information. Copy the generated YAML into your `_config.yml`.

Once that's in place, start up your hexo server and going to `/admin/` will
require you to enter your password.

### 4. Custom post metadata
To add and edit your own post metadata with the admin interface, add the
metadata variable and your custom variables to your hexo `_config.yml`:
```
metadata:
  author_id: defaultAuthorId
  language:
```
You can provide default values that will be used to initialize the metadata
of a new post.
